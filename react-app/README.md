This folder contains a Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold for the Spelling Bee UI.

Run locally:

1. Install dependencies (from `react-app`):

   npm install

2. Start dev server:

   npm run dev

Open the URL printed by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173)

Next steps:
- Integrate the existing `gameCore` module by implementing `src/lib/gameAdapter.ts` and then rendering the game canvas inside `GameView`.
- Add Settings and voice selection pages.
